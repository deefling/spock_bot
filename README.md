Hello, welcome to Spock-bot!

To run:
- have node.js installed
- make an app on the discord developer portal
- make a .env file with the following info in it:
    - TOKEN (should be under Bot section of the website)
    - CLIENT_ID (Application ID on General Information page of your app)
    - GUILD_ID (your development server ID, I think its possible to have it on multiple servers but that's not how I have it set up right now)

- don't forget to npm -i to install the dependencies

Heres some useful commands:
- npm run dev - this continuously runs the bot & updates it when you save
- npm run deploy - deploys commands, necessary to run when creating commands, and when modifying options/subcommands
